Examine code determine to refactor or not before adding new elements
to the game

Add a single alien to top-left corner with proper spacing

Use spacing around the first alien and the overal screen to determine
how many aliens will fit on the screen. Write a loop to create aliens to
fil the upper portion of the screen

Make the aliens move downward and across the screen until shot down,
hits the ship or the ground. If ain alien hits the ship or the ground
we destroy the ship and create a new ship

Limit the number of ships the player has and end the game once the 
number of allotment of ships have been reached.
